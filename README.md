# SixArm® pitch deck template

A pitch deck is a business slideshow presentation:

  * A pitch deck summarizes a project and purpose, 
    such as summarizing a startup and product.

  * A pitch deck is a fundraising fundamental, and is
    often requested by potential investors and advisors.

The pitch deck template below is a quick start:

  * Timebox doing your first draft, then show it to
    people, gather feedback, and work to improve it.

  * When you pitch a specific person or team, such as an 
    investor or firm, customize your pitch deck to them.
